# HireMe

I am a proven and passionate Software Engineer with over five years’ experience in the UK Cyber Defence industry. My technical experience is steered towards C# & Python, with a heavy focus on Continuous Integration and Test Automation. I have also acquired a wide breadth of knowledge across the Computer Security and Software Engineering space.

I currently lead a technical team of developers and testers on a high-value, multi-year technical project for a large UK organisation. As an experienced Software Engineer and qualified Scrum Master I am driven to optimise delivery by refining software development and testing practices, removing blockers and streamlining processes.

Outside of technical project work I enjoy contributing and being a part of my company’s community. I take an active role in research & innovation, mentoring and training, and use every opportunity I can to network. I am also a STEM Ambassador and volunteer my time in schools to promote technical careers.

I am currently looking for a new role in Software Engineering or Cyber Security. I would be very interested in hearing about any 100% remote positions that offer flexibility in the timezone in which I am able to work.
